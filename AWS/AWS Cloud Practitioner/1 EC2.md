**Amazon #EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
### Types of Instances
There are five primary types of EC2 instances, each optimized for specific use cases:
1. **Compute-Optimized**
    - These instances are designed for compute-intensive tasks, such as physical or chemical modeling. They provide a high ratio of compute power to memory.
2. **Memory-Optimized**
    - Ideal for applications that process large data sets in memory, such as in-memory databases or real-time big data analytics.
3. **Storage-Optimized**
    - These instances are designed for high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage, making them suitable for databases.
4. **General-Purpose**
    - These instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, suitable for a variety of workloads, including web servers and small databases.
5. **Accelerated Computing**
    - These instances allow you to connect GPUs to accelerate computational tasks, such as machine learning, gaming, or graphics rendering. They are beneficial for workloads that require high levels of floating-point performance.

Every #EC2 instance goes with different amount of vCPU. A vCPU, by the way, is an arbitrary—and somewhat mysterious—metric used by AWS to describe the compute power you’ll get from a given instance. It’s meant to make you think in terms of the multiprocessor CPUs on consumer and server motherboards, where more is generally better. But it’s notoriously difficult to accurately map the value of a single vCPU against any one real-world device.
### Pricing Models
Amazon EC2 offers several pricing options
1. **Spot Instances**
    - Allows you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at potentially lower rates. However, if AWS needs the capacity back, your instances can be terminated. Ideal for fault-tolerant applications that can handle interruptions.
2. **Reserved Instances**
    - Provides a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to on-demand pricing for reserving instances for a 1-year or 3-year term. There are two types:
        - **Standard Reserved Instances**: You must specify the instance type, size, and region upfront.
        - **Convertible Reserved Instances**: Offers more flexibility as you can change instance types, but with a lower discount.
    - Reserved instances are paid for using an All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront payment option. Predictably, the more you pay up front, the less it’ll cost you overall.
1. **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**
    - Similar to reserved instances but offers more flexibility. You commit to a certain amount of compute usage over 1 or 3 years, and AWS provides a discount without the need to specify instance types or regions.
2. **On-Demand Instances**
    - The most flexible option, allowing you to pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (depending on the instance type) without long-term commitments. However, this is generally the most expensive option.
3. **Dedicated Hosts**
    - Physical servers that are fully dedicated to your use, allowing you to meet compliance requirements and use existing server-bound software licenses.

### Amazon EC2 Instance Store Volumes
Amazon EC2 Instance Store Volumes Unlike #EBS, those instance types compatible with instance store volumes can enjoy the benefits of having their data on physical drives attached directly to the physical instance Deploying Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Servers 125 server. The downsides of instance store volumes (ephemeral data, no encryption, and lack of flexibility) are offset by faster data reads and writes. This can be useful for processing and analyzing fast-moving data streams where the data itself doesn’t need to be persistent.
### Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
**Auto Scaling** is a service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to the demand for your application. There are two main types of scaling:
1. **Dynamic Scaling**
    - Adjusts the number of instances in real-time based on current demand metrics.
2. **Predictive Scaling**
    - Uses machine learning to anticipate future demand and automatically scales your EC2 instances accordingly.
When creating an Auto Scaling group, you must specify:
- The **minimum** and **maximum** number of instances.
- The **desired capacity**, which is not necessarily equal to the minimum.
 Since auto-scaling only provisions the instances you use, you only pay for the capacity utilized. The Auto Scaling service itself incurs no additional costs.


### Boto3 Example
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it via pip if it's not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install boto3
	```
- Make sure you have AWS credentials configured (typically in `~/.aws/credentials`).

	#### Example Code
```python
import boto3  

def launch_ec2_instance():
	session = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
						aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',        
						region_name='us-west-2') 
						 
    ec2 = session.resource('ec2')      
    # Launch a new EC2 instance     
	instance = ec2.create_instances(
	ImageId='ami-0123456789abcdef0',
	MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1,         
    InstanceType='t2.micro',  # Choose your instance type   
    KeyName='your-key-pair'  # Replace with your key pair name     
    ) 
	 print(f"Launched EC2 instance: {instance[0].id}")
`````
