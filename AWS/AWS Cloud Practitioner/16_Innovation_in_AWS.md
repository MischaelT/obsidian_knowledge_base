**Innovate with AWS Services**

When examining how to use AWS services, it is important to focus on the desired outcomes. You are properly equipped to drive innovation in the cloud if you can clearly articulate the following conditions: 

- The current state
- The desired state
- The problems you are trying to solve

Consider some of the paths you might explore in the future as you continue on your cloud journey. 

To learn more on ways to innovate with AWS, expand each of the following three categories.

## 

Serverless applications

With AWS, **serverless** refers to applications that don’t require you to provision, maintain, or administer servers. You don’t need to worry about fault tolerance or availability. AWS handles these capabilities for you.

  

AWS Lambda is an example of a service that you can use to run serverless applications. If you design your architecture to trigger Lambda functions to run your code, you can bypass the need to manage a fleet of servers.

  

Building your architecture with serverless applications enables your developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers.

## 

Artificial intelligence

AWS offers a variety of services powered by **artificial intelligence (AI)**. 

  

For example, you can perform the following tasks:

- Convert speech to text with Amazon Transcribe.
- Discover patterns in text with Amazon Comprehend.
- Identify potentially fraudulent online activities with Amazon Fraud Detector.
- Build voice and text chatbots with Amazon Lex.

## 

Machine learning

Traditional **machine learning (ML)** development is complex, expensive, time consuming, and error prone. AWS offers Amazon SageMaker to remove the difficult work from the process and empower you to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.

  

You can use ML to analyze data, solve complex problems, and predict outcomes before they happen.

**What is Amazon Q Developer?  
**

When we show up to the present moment with all of our senses, we invite the world to fill us with joy. The pains of the past are behind us. The future has yet to unfold. But the now is full of beauty simply waiting for our attention.

Amazon Q Developer is a machine learning-powered code generator that provides you with code recommendations in real time.

As you write code, Amazon Q Developer analyzes your code and comments as you write code in your integrated development environment (IDE). Amazon Q Developer then automatically generates suggestions based on your existing code and comments.

Additionally, Amazon Q Developer analyzes the surrounding code, ensuring the generated code matches your style, naming conventions, and seamlessly integrates into the existing context.

## 

**Installation**

Developers can easily access Amazon Q Developer by downloading and installing the AWS Toolkit IDE extension. You can also activate Amazon Q Developer from directly within the AWS Lambda and AWS Cloud9 console code editors.


## 

**Compatibility**

Amazon Q Developer seamlessly integrates with popular tools like Visual Studio (VS) Code, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.), Amazon SageMaker Studio, JupyterLab, AWS Cloud9, and the AWS Lambda console.

## 

**Support**

It supports a wide range of programming languages and development environments, including Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell scripting, SQL, and Scala.

## 

**Code Generation  
**

User actions will vary depending on the tools you're integrating with. Take a look at the table below for an example of user actions available in VS Code.

|User actions|   |
|---|---|
|Previous and Next recommendation|Left arrow and Right arrow|
|Accept a recommendation|Tab|
|Reject a recommendation|ESC|
|Manually trigger code generation when typing a comment|MacOS [option]-[c], Windows [Alt]-[c]|
