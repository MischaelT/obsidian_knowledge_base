One step beyond a managed service—which handles only one part of your deployment stack for you—is a managed deployment, where the whole stack is taken care of behind the scenes. All you’ll need to make things work with one of these services is your application code or, if it’s a website you’re after, your content.
## Amazon Lightsail
#Lightsail is promoted as a low-stress way to enter the Amazon cloud world. It offers blueprints that, when launched, will automatically provision all the compute, storage, database, and network resources needed to make your deployment work. You set the pricing level you’re after (currently that’ll cost you somewhere between $3.50 and $160 USD each month) and add an optional script that will be run on your instance at startup, and AWS will take over.
## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- A platform-as-a-service (#PaaS) that simplifies the deployment of web applications and services.
- Automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring.
- Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks (e.g., Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python).
