### AWS Regions
A **region** is a physical location where AWS clusters its data centers. Each region is isolated and designed to operate independently from other regions to provide the highest possible fault tolerance and stability. When you select a region for your application, you can ensure that your data stays within that specific geographic location, meeting various compliance and performance requirements.
If you're running an app in the **eu-central-1** (Frankfurt) region, for example, you can be confident that your data will not leave that region unless configured otherwise.
#### Factors to Consider When Choosing an AWS Region:
1. **Compliance with Data Governance and Legal Requirements**
    - Some laws require that specific data be stored within certain geographic borders. For instance, EU data laws may require data related to EU citizens to be stored within the EU. Choosing a region that aligns with these regulations is crucial.
2. **Proximity to Your Customers**
    - Choosing a region close to your primary customer base minimizes latency. For instance, if most of your customers are in Ohio, deploying your app in a region like **us-east-2 (Ohio)** would provide a better user experience than hosting it in **ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)**.
3. **Service Availability**
    - Not all AWS services are available in every region. For example, newer services or specific AI models in **AWS Bedrock** might only be available in select regions.
4. **Pricing**
    - AWS pricing varies by region. Some regions, like **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**, often have lower costs due to economies of scale compared to others, like **ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)**.

### Availability Zones (AZ)
An **Availability Zone (#AZ)** consists of one or more data centers within a region. Each #AZ is designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs in the same region. When you launch an **#EC2 instance**, it physically resides in one specific AZ.

If your application relies on a single #EC2 instance within one AZ, an incident like a natural disaster affecting that AZ could bring your app down. To increase resilience, it’s best practice to run instances across **at least two AZs within the same region**. This ensures that, even if one AZ is impacted, your application remains operational.

### AWS CloudFront
**AWS CloudFront** is a Content Delivery Network (#CDN) that speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic content to users by caching copies at **edge locations** (data centers located globally). These edge locations bring data closer to the end-users, reducing latency.

For example, if your servers and files are based in Canada but many customers access your site from Japan, #CloudFront can cache your content at an edge location close to Japan. This minimizes the need to retrieve data from Canada each time, significantly reducing latency.

Not all content types are good candidates for CloudFront caching. Files that are frequently updated or that are accessed by end users only once in a while would probably not justify the expense of saving to cache.

In addition to the fleet of regular edge locations, Amazon has further enhanced CloudFront functionality by adding what it calls a regional edge cache. The idea is that CloudFrontserved objects are maintained in edge location caches only as long as there’s a steady flow of requests. Once the rate of new requests drops off, an object will be deleted from the cache, and future requests will need to travel all the way back to the origin server (like an S3 bucket). Regional edge cache locations—of which there are currently nine worldwide—can offer a compromise solution. Objects rejected by edge locations can be moved to the regional edge caches. There aren’t as many such locations worldwide, so the response times for many user requests won’t be as fast, but that’ll still probably be better than having to go all the way back to the origin. By design, regional edge cache locations are more capable of handling less-popular content

#CDN

The more edge locations you use, the more redundancy you have and the better performance you can expect. As you might expect, the price of CloudFront increases as you utilize more edge locations. You can’t select individual edge locations. Rather, you must choose from the following three options: ■ United States, Canada, and Europe ■ United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Africa ■ All edge locations

To make your content available via CloudFront, you must create a distribution. A distribution defines the type of content you want CloudFront to cache, as well as the content’s origin—where CloudFront should retrieve the content from. There are two types of distributions: Web and Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). Web A Web distribution is the most common type. It’s used for static and dynamic content such as web pages, graphic files, and live or on-demand streaming video. Users can access Web distributions via HTTP or HTTPS. When creating a Web distribution, you must specify an origin to act as the authoritative source for your content. An origin can be a web server or a public S3 bucket. You can’t use nonpublic S3 buckets. RTMP The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) delivers streaming video or audio content to end users. To set up an RTMP distribution, you must provide both a media player and media files to stream, and these must be stored in S3 buckets
