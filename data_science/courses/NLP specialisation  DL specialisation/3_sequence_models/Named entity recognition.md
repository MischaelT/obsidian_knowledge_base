Named Entity Recognition (NER) locates and extracts predefined entities from text. It allows you to find places, organizations, names, time and dates. Here is an example:

NER systems are being used in search efficiency, recommendation engines, customer service, automatic trading, and many more.


For NER, you have to:

- Convert words and entity classes into arrays:
- Pad with tokens: Set sequence length to a certain number and use the PAD token to fill empty spaces
- Create a data generator:

Once you have that, you can assign each class a number, and each word a number.

### **Training an NER system:**

1. Create a tensor for each input and its corresponding numberÂ 
2. Put them in a batch ==> 64, 128, 256, 512 ...
3. Feed it into an LSTM unit
4. Run the output through a dense layer
5. Predict using a log softmax over K classes

Here is an example of the architecture:
