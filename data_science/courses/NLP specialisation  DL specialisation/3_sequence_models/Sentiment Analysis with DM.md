- Naïve Bayes not always makes possible to make sentiment analysis on a compicated texts. Thats why we need to use more sophisticated models.
- This neural network will allow you to predict sentiments for complex tweets such as a tweet like this one:
	`this movie was almost good`
	You wouldn't have been able to classify correctly using simpler methods such as naïve base because they missed important information.

- In this course we're using trax as framework to build the models
