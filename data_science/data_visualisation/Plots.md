			- minimun: smallest data. First quartile - 1.5IQR
			- first quartile: 25% of the data are less than this
			- median
			- third quartile: 75% are bigger than this
			- maximum: third + 1.5IQR
			- outliers (not dimension)
 - scatter plot
		-  displayes variables pertaining to typically two vars against each other. 
		- Usually the dependent in front of the independent. This allows to determine if there is any correlation between two variables
