- from torch import optim
- In PyTorch, the "optim" module provides various optimization algorithms that can be used to train neural networks. It contains implementations of popular optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, and more.
- The "optim" module in PyTorch allows you to define an optimizer object, which is responsible for updating the parameters of a neural network during the training process. These optimizers use the gradients computed during backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases of the network in order to minimize the loss function.

- Here are some commonly used classes and functions available in the "optim" module:
	- `optim.SGD`: Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer.
	- `optim.Adam`: Adam optimizer, which combines ideas from AdaGrad and RMSProp.
	- `optim.Adagrad`: Adagrad optimizer, which adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradients.
	- `optim.RMSprop`: RMSprop optimizer, which uses a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the learning rate.
	- `optim.lr_scheduler`: A module that provides various learning rate schedulers, such as StepLR, ReduceLROnPlateau, and LambdaLR.
