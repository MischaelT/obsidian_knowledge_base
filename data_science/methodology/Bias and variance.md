 - For example, if youre getting 1% of error on your train set and 11% on the test set, that could mean that you have high variance, or overfitting
 - On the other hand, if you're having the 15% on the train and 14% on the test set, that means that you have high bias
 - if 15% test and 30% on train it means high bias and high variance
 - 0.5% train, 1% test -- low bias, low variance
