- Classification algorithms predict categorical classed labels. This means assigning instances to predefined classes such as defaulted or not defaulted. For example, if an analyst wants to analyze customer data in order to know which customers might default on their payments, she uses a labeled dataset as training data and uses classification approaches such as a decision tree, Support Vector Machines or SVM, or logistic regression, to predict the default value for a new or unknown customer. Generally speaking, classification is a supervised learning where each training data instance belongs to a particular class. In clustering however, the data is unlabeled and the process is unsupervised. For example, we can use a clustering algorithm such as k-means to group similar customers as mentioned, and assign them to a cluster, based on whether they share similar attributes, such as; age, education, and so on.
